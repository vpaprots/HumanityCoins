# HumanityCoins

<!--- [![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/vpaprots/HumanityCoins.git) --->


# Application background

This application will demonstrate a HumanityCoins point system where users can honour each other with HumanityCoins. Later HumanityCoins can also be collected by wearable devices, or smart meters, rewarding people saving resources (electricity, water, gas) or living a healthy lifestyle reported by their wearable device. To avoid abuse of the system these points are audited by a tweeting auditor (using twitter). The HumanityCoins points can be used by companies and government bodies to reward people doing good to their communities, health and to the environment.

### NOTE: This version is compatible with Hyperledger v1.0 docker containers

# Project setup:
To try out the project, follow the following guide to install the perequisits:
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html


Demo can be run with /demo/startFabric.sh script which starts up the relevant docker containers,
deploys the chaincode and run an invoke method. 


Alternatively it can be deployed into a chaincode development docker network:
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4ade.html

## Replace the Terminal 2 and 3 parts with the following:
### Terminal 2:

cd humanity

go build

CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer:7051 CORE_CHAINCODE_ID_NAME=mycc:0 ./humanity

### Terminal 3:
docker exec -it cli bash

peer chaincode install -p chaincodedev/chaincode/humanity -n mycc -v 0

peer chaincode instantiate -n mycc -v 0 -c '{"Args":["alice","10", "bob","20"]}' -C myc

peer chaincode invoke -n mycc -c '{"Function":"addThanks", "Args": ["bob","{\"name\":\"alice\",\"type\":\"thankyou\",\"message\":\"for being good\"}"]}' -C myc

peer chaincode query -n mycc -c '{"Function":"getUser", "Args":["alice"]}' -C myc
